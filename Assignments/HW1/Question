The main goal of this homework is to write a computer program that simulates the motion of a robot in a 2D environment.
The robot should be able to move in any direction with a constant velocity, while avoiding obstacles. (Random motion)
The obstacle avoidance approach should consist in computing the Euclidian distance of the robot in 8 directions (45 degrees separation) with a defined collision threshold.
Your simulator should be able to:
-	Stream relative rotation
-	Stream absolute position
-	Stream relative translation
-	Switch on/off path tracking
-	Save the data and record a video
